Notes:

* [2:20] Major Advances for Cpp26
  1. Reflections-P2996: Meta program; lets us write programs that write other programs. Other languages have run time meta programming that is slow; cpp26 is compile time
  2. Memory Safety Parity
* Context for Cpp26
  * In Sept 2024, only 9 months away from Cpp26
* History of other updates to the standard
  * Constexpr came in cpp11, and evolved to make other compile time
  * GPUs: similar evolution to constexpr
  * Reflection is stepwise as well [12:00]

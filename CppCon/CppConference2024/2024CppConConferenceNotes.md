## Talks Attended

### "LLVM's Realtime Safety Revolution: Tools for Modern Mission Control Systems" by Chris Apple and David Trevelyan

[Link To Talk](https://cppcon2024.sched.com/event/1gZgL/llvms-realtime-safety-revolution-tools-for-modern-mission-critical-systems)

[Link to RTSan Project](https://github.com/realtime-sanitizer/rtsan)

Notes and Key Features of RTSan:

* Autogenerated Documentation
* Real-Time Safety Guarantees
* CI Pipeline Integration
* LLVM 20/Clang 20 dependent for now
* Differences between Clang Non-Allocating and Non-blocking

### "How Meta Made Debugging Async Code Easier" by Jessica Wong and Ian Petersen

[Link to Talk Abstract](https://cppcon2024.sched.com/event/1gZgT/how-meta-made-debugging-async-code-easier-with-coroutines-and-senders)

[Link To Demo Project](https://github.com/fbsamples/cppcon24-async-demo)

Check out their episode of the CppCast for more details on this topic!

Topics I should investigate after this talk:

* LLDB
* Unifex Library
* Co_bt (coroutine backtrace?)
* Lib Unwind

### Safety and Security Panel

[Link to Abstract](https://cppcon2024.sched.com/event/1kYBw/safety-and-security-panel)

Hot Topics Discussed in this Panel:

* Contracts for Cpp26, and the proposal process
  * Very useful for testing
* Working Group 21
* ISO C++ Contracts for Safety and Security
* Question: How do you quantify safety in a C++ Code Base
* Safety as a foundational pillar for your organization
* RUST (gasp)
  * Safety by Default for Rust, but "unsafe" code is still possible
  * If starting a new code base from scratch today, options to consider
  * Type and memory safety are advantages that other languages have over C++
  * Herb Sutter Argues for Parity vs Perfection
  * Sean Baxter's Prototype of ["Safe, Borrow Checked C++"](https://cppcast.com/safe-borrow-checked-cpp/)
    * Some think that borrow checking was implemented a bit too literally, to a point where it's not even C++ code anymore, it is a rust imitation
    * Bloomberg is apparently dumping millions of dollars to follow up on that work
* Possible Definition of Correctness: Absence of undefined behavior?

### "Back to Basics: Function Resolution" by Ben Saks

[Link to Abstract](https://cppcon2024.sched.com/event/1gZdm/back-to-basics-function-call-resolution)

* ADL
* Sutter Interface Principle
* Compiler's Ranking system for function resolution
* Qualified and Unqualified Names
* Structural Types

### "Fast and Small C++ - When Efficiency Matters" By Andreas Fertig

[Link to abstract](https://cppcon2024.sched.com/event/1gZfc/fast-and-small-c-when-efficiency-matters)

* Takeaway: This was a fascinating talk detailing some creative (and a bit hacky too) ways to reduce the size of a common data structure like string. Many have embarked on the challenge: how small can I make this library? But this is an exploration of different approaches to optimize on size, and the costs of that optimization. 

### "Compile Time Validation" by Alon Wolf

[Link to abstract](https://cppcon2024.sched.com/event/1gZgF/compile-time-validation)

Topics covered, and those that I should look into afterwards:

* ISO 24643
* Rust Vulnerabilities
* Stateful Metaprogramming
* Compiler Loopholes for Cpp23
* Anonymous Lambdas
* Meta State
* std::expect, static assert nesting

### "Contracts for Cpp" by Timur Doulmer

[Link to abstract](https://cppcon2024.sched.com/event/1gZfV/contracts-for-c)

* Introducing Contracts has been a challenge of creating an Egg Laying Wool Milk Pig
* Lakos Rule
* Heisenbugs
* P3097

### "Building Safe and Reliable Surgical Robotics with C++" by Milad Khaledyan and Alexander Drew

[Link to abstract](https://cppcon2024.sched.com/event/1gZgI/building-safe-and-reliable-surgical-robotics-with-c)

Takeaways: This was one of the best intros to medical device development that I've ever seen. I am excited to add this to Medtronic's onboarding materials.

Notes:

* Mitre Common Weakness enumeration
* Maude FDA Failure Analysis
* AAMI for Agile
* Medical Device HQ Site for resources
* Bar Group 2018 Embedded Systems 
* Functional Safety, Correctness, and security
* Modular designs: Less coupling
* Enforced Processing and tooling
* Open SSF (Open source security framework)
* Guard Rails
* Look for allocator in STL dynamic memory allocators
* Quick-bench.com
